# Schantz Challenge 2017

Like last year, Schantz A/S is holding a code golf competition. This
repository contains my research notes, failed attempts, experiments,
as well as the 2 programs that won first place in each of the 2
categories.

Challenge: Write the shortest possible program that outputs the yearly
reserves for Santa’s pension until he has enough to retire and buy the
island of Kiatak (> 1.000.000 DKK).

The exact rules are described in the [LinkedIn
announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/schantz-new-years-coding-challenge-2017-espen-højsgaard).

There are 2 categories:

 - Category 1: Only C# and Java are allowed

 - Category 2: Anything goes, except languages invented for this challenge.

## Give it to me straight, doc!

Ok, ok. I get it, you want to cut to the chase. The 2 winning entries are:

 - Category 1: [2017-19.cs](2017-19.cs) (66 characeters)
 - Category 2: [2017-17.gs2s](2017-17.gs2s) (assembles to `2017-17.gs2`) (33 characeters)
